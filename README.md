# Rotated grids in C#

ðŸŽ¨ _For halftone dithering and more._

This project provides an enumerator for creating grid coordinates at a specified frequency along
a rotated grid. This can come in useful e.g. when you want to create halftone dithering grids for CMYK processing.

It is a port of the [rotated-grid](https://github.com/sunsided/rotated-grid) Rust crate.
Please see there for screenshots and examples.
